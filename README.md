My name is Nic Dalmasso and I am a PhD student in the Statistics & Data Science department at Carnegie Mellon university. I work in statistical machine learning methodologies for uncertainty quantification. The questions I try to solve are usually motivated by problem in the physical sciences; our research group at CMU ((STAMPS)[http://stat.cmu.edu/stamps/]) is pretty active in this area! I strive to have a public repository for each of my projects.

- ðŸ’¬ If you are interested in any of the code, feel free to fork and start playing with it!
